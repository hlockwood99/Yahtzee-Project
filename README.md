# Yahtzee

###### Rules
The objective of the game is to score points by rolling five dice to make certain combinations. The dice can be rolled up to three times in a turn to try to make various scoring combinations. A game consists of thirteen rounds. After each round the player chooses which scoring category is to be used for that round. Once a category has been used in the game, it cannot be used again. The scoring categories have varying point values, some of which are fixed values and others where the score depends on the value of the dice. A Yahtzee is five-of-a-kind and scores 50 points; the highest of any category. The winner is the player who scores the most points.

### Plan

There is a Dice class as well as a Yahtzee class. The Dice class will generate the numbers for each die and will provide the final values to be used for scoring. The Yahtzee class contains the conditions of Yahtzee, such as three of a kind, four of a kind, small straight, large straight, Yahtzee, etc. This class will take care of...

Henry will be working on the Dice class and Michael will be working on the Yahtzee class.

Lastly, there will be a runner file where the user will be able to play the Yahtzee game and will be asked questions such as, "Would you like to roll again?" or "What die(s) would you like to keep?"
