# Yahtzee

###### Rules
The objective of the game is to score points by rolling five dice to make certain combinations. The dice can be rolled up to three times in a turn to try to make various scoring combinations. A game consists of thirteen rounds. After each round the player chooses which scoring category is to be used for that round. Once a category has been used in the game, it cannot be used again. The scoring categories have varying point values, some of which are fixed values and others where the score depends on the value of the dice. A Yahtzee is five-of-a-kind and scores 50 points; the highest of any category. The winner is the player who scores the most points.

### Plan
We plan to make a function that has an array of all the possible faces of a die, and in that function return the frenquency of a face among the current set of dice.

Next, we will make a new array of all of the counts of the die. We can then sort of the array and test for the conditions of Yahtzee, such as three of a kind, four of a kind, small straight, large straight, Yahtzee, etc.

Lastly, there will be a testing class where we will run the functions and we can check to see if the code works!

Michael plans to write the conditions and Henry plans to make the array, which counts the frequency of the dice and sets the conditions, such as the number of rolls. Together, they will write the testing class.
